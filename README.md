# Quick setup of rtl8821ce wifi driver with DKMS

Every time i reinstall my laptop's OS (Ubuntu-based), I have to do a few lines of code in the terminal to get the wifi driver to work.

This is just a simple bash-script that does it all in one go.

The code was originally gotten from this forumpost: https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=290073
